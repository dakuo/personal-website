Dr. Dakuo Wang is a Research Staff Member at IBM Research AI, and Principal Investigator at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, based at Cambridge, MA. His research lies in the intersection between human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI). Before joining IBM Research, Dakuo got his Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (advisor: [Judith Olson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_S._Olson) and [Gary Olson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_M._Olson)).

He is now leading a team to conduct research and design user experience for IBM AutoAI. Outside his IBM work, Dakuo is also broadly interested in how human interact with real-world AI applications such as conversational agents and clinical decision support systems (Human-AI Collaboration). ACM has recognized Dakuo Wang as an [ACM Distinguished Speaker](https://speakers.acm.org/speakers/wang_12069).

Dakuo Wang (Chinese Name: 王大阔) is a Research Team Lead @ IBM Research AI, and a Principal Investigator at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, based in Cambridge Massachusetts. His research lies in the intersection between human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI). He is now leading a team of researchers, engineers, and designers to conduct research and design user experience for IBM AutoAI, a solution to automate the AI modeling pipeline. Outside his IBM work, Dakuo is also broadly interested in how people interact with real-world AI applications, in particular conversational agents and clinical decision support systems. He proposes the “Human-AI Collaboration” paradigm to study and design AI systems to work together with humans.

#Before joining IBM Research, Dakuo Wang got his Ph.D. and M.S. in Information and Computer Science from the University of California Irvine, a Diplôme d’Ingénieur (M.S.) in Information System from École Centrale d’Électronique Paris, and a B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Technology. He has worked as an engineer, designer, and researcher in France, China, and the United States.

#Dakuo Wang now serves in ACM SIGCHI China Chapter as a Vice-President, and International Chinese Association of CHI (ICACHI) steering commitee 2018-2022, as well as in Program Committee for various SIGCHI-sponsored conferences. ACM has recognized Dakuo Wang as an ACM Distinguished Speaker in 2019.

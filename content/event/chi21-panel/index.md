abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can refer to the machine learning
  algorithms and the automation applications built on top of these algorithms.
  Human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers have studied these AI
  applications and suggested various Human-Centered AI (HCAI) principles for an
  explainable, safe, reliable, and trustworthy interaction experience. While
  some designers believe that computers should be supertools and active
  appliances, others believe that these latest AI systems can be collaborators.
  With todayâ€™s AI algorithm breakthroughs, in this panel we ask whether the
  supertool or the collaboration metaphors best support work and play? How can
  we design AI systems to work best with people or for people? What does it take
  to get there? This panel will bring together panelists with diverse
  backgrounds to engage the audience through the discussion of their shared or
  diverging visions on the future of human-AI interaction design.

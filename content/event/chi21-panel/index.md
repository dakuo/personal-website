summary: A CHI'21 panel discussion on "Designing AI to Work WITH or FOR People?"
abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can refer to the machine learning algorithms and the automation applications built on top of these algorithms. Human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers have studied these AI applications and suggested various Human-Centered AI (HCAI) principles for an explainable, safe, reliable, and trustworthy interaction experience. While some designers believe that computers should be supertools and active appliances, others believe that these latest AI systems can be collaborators. With today's AI algorithm breakthroughs, in this panel we ask whether the supertool or the collaboration metaphors best support work and play? How can we design AI systems to work best with people or for people? What does it take to get there? This panel will bring together panelists with diverse backgrounds to engage the audience through the discussion of their shared or diverging visions on the future of human-AI interaction design."

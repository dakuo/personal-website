abstract: "Parent-child interactive storytelling is a crucial activity for children development, but parents may face challenges in creating engaging stories or may not always be available. We present StoryBuddy, an AI-powered chatbot that collaborates with parents and children in interactive storytelling. StoryBuddy supports flexible parental involvement, allowing parents to participate actively or let the system take the lead when needed. Our system generates coherent story content while encouraging children creativity and engagement through questions and suggestions. We conducted a within-subjects study with 16 parent-child pairs, comparing StoryBuddy to a voice-based storytelling application. Results show that StoryBuddy effectively supports parent-child collaboration, enhances story interactivity, and accommodates different levels of parental involvement, making quality storytelling experiences more accessible to families."

abstract: "Mental health conditions affect millions of people worldwide, yet many remain undiagnosed or untreated due to various barriers. This paper introduces Mental-LLM, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to predict mental health conditions from individuals online text data. We fine-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 12,486 Reddit users with self-reported mental health conditions and 13,735 control users, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Mental-LLM outperforms traditional machine learning models and smaller language models, demonstrating superior performance even with limited training data. Our approach offers a promising direction for early mental health screening and intervention through analysis of online text data."

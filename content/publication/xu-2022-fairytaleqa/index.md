abstract: 'Question answering (QA) is a fundamental means to facilitate assessment and training of narrative comprehension skills for both machines and young children. However, existing QA datasets for narrative comprehension are limited in their size and diversity. To address this, we introduce FairytaleQA, a dataset focusing on narrative comprehension of kindergarten to eighth-grade reading levels. Generated by educational experts based on an evidence-based theoretical framework, FairytaleQA consists of 10,580 explicit and implicit questions derived from 278 children-friendly stories. Our dataset covers seven types of narrative elements: character, setting, action, feeling, causal relationship, outcome resolution, and prediction. Through in-depth analysis and human evaluation, we demonstrate the quality of the dataset and show that the narrative elements are evenly distributed and human-answerable. We further provide baseline performance on state-of-the-art QA models and analyze their capabilities and limitations. FairytaleQA is the first large-scale QA dataset designed to support narrative comprehension in education, with potential applications in educational assessment and training of both machines and young readers.'

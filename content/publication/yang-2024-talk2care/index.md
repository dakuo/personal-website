abstract: "Effective communication between healthcare providers and older adults is crucial for quality care but faces challenges such as time constraints and communication barriers. We present Talk2Care, an LLM-based voice assistant designed to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and older adults. Talk2Care leverages large language models to understand medical information, generate personalized responses, and maintain conversational context. We conducted a user study with 12 older adults and 6 healthcare providers to evaluate the system. Results show that Talk2Care effectively addresses communication challenges by providing clear explanations of medical information, maintaining conversational context, and adapting to individual needs. Both older adults and healthcare providers found the system helpful and easy to use. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-based voice assistants to enhance healthcare communication and improve care experiences for older adults."
